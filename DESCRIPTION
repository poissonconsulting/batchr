Description: Processes multiple files with a user-supplied
    function. The key design principle is that only files which were 
    last modified before the directory was configured are processed.
    A hidden file stores the configuration time and function etc while 
    successfully processed files are automatically touched to update 
    their modification date. As a result batch processing can be 
    stopped and restarted and any files created (or modified or deleted) 
    during processing are ignored.
