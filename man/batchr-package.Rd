\title{batchr: Batch Process Files}
\description{
Batch processes files with a user-supplied R
    function. The key design principle is that only files which were 
    last modified before the directory was configured are processed.
    A hidden file stores the configuration time and function etc while 
    successfully processed files are automatically 'touched' to update 
    their modification date.
